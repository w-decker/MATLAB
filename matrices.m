% This code consists of the development of different matrices

% The following code consists of the development of different types of matricies.

% row vector
vect1 = [1 2 3 5 1 2 88 3 1 ];

% column vector
vect2  = [3;5;3;1;4];

% column vector by transposing a row vector
vect3 = [1 28 38 1 4 2 4 5 ]'
vect4 = transpose( [ 1 3 2 5 1 2 1])

% 2x3 matrix 
matr1 = [ 1 0 3; 4 0 4; ]

matr2 = transpose( [ 1 0 3; 3 0 5;]); 

% make a row vector of ones

onesvect1 = [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1];
        % or you can use the ones function
onesvect2 = ones(4,1);

% column vector of .25

pointtwofive1 = ones(8,1)*0.25;
ponttwofive2 = zeros(8, 1) + 0.25 


% matrix of random numbers
matr = rand(4,6);
